# Introduction

Welcome to My Tech Learning Journey! I'm a technical writer and curriculum developer with a passion for making complex tech concepts accessible. With experience in cloud computing, automation, and data analytics, I’ve worked on training programs for major companies like Intel and Google. Now, I’m using AI to enhance my learning process—breaking down new technologies, tracking my progress, and sharing insights along the way. This site is my personal knowledge base - I also really miss writing for fun -  and a space for others looking to learn alongside me. Let’s explore tech together!

## What I'm Working On

I have to admit that my interests when it comes to tech - and life! - are extremely varied, but some of the things that I'm working on right now:
- A course in API documentation
- Learning to deploy my own site (this one!)
- Python
